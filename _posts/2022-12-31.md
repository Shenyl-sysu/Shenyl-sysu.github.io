## Abstarct

In map multiscale visualization, typification is the process of replacing original objects, such as buildings, using a smaller number of objects while maintaining initial geometrical and distribution characteristics. During the past few decades, many vector-based methods for building typification have been developed, whereas raster-based methods have received less attention. In this paper, a new method for the typification of buildings with different distribution patterns called superpixel building typification (SUBT) is developed based on raster data. Using this method, buildings with different distribution patterns, such as linear, grid and irregular patterns, are first grouped by image connected component detection and superpixel analysis. Then, the new positions for building typification are determined by superpixel resegmentation. Finally, a new representation of the buildings is determined through analysis of the orientation and shape of the buildings in each superpixel. To test the proposed SUBT method, buildings from both cities and countrysides in China are applied to perform typification. The experimental results show that the proposed SUBT method can realize typification for buildings with linear, grid and irregular distributions while effectively maintaining the original distribution characteristics of the buildings.
