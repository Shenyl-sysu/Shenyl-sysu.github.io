## Abstarct

Computer screens often constrain the level of detail and clarity of displays. High-density data require a predefined strategy to select significant features hierarchically to allow interactive data zooming. Although many methods are available for hierarchically selecting rivers from vector data, some approaches for raster data are better than others for maintaining accuracy when the original river data are in a raster format during generalization. In this study, a raster-based approach is proposed to allow hierarchical superpixel selection in river networks. Linear spectral clustering segmentation was applied to divide the original raster river networks into superpixels at multiple levels. A graph was constructed to organize the generated river network superpixels based on the distances between adjacent superpixels by considering the weights determined by the four types of rules. Finally, the total weight values were ranked, the river-network superpixels were selected according to their weights, and the redundant pixels at the river-network intersections were removed. Compared with the traditional vector selection method, the proposed superpixel river network selection method can effectively consider the characteristics of river width without artificial river grading and preserve the main structure and connectivity features during hierarchical mapping. Notably, the average geometry and density changes decreased by 15.8% and 5.1%, respectively.
