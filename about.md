title: About Me
---
I am a Associate Professor at the School of Geospatial Engineering and Science and Technology, [Sun Yat-Sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/). Before joining SYSU, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the （实验室或学院） at the [University of Bonn](https://www.uni-bonn.de/en), supervised by （某位导师）. Before that, I received my Ph.D. and B.S. and worked as a postdoctoral fellow at School of Resource and Environmental Sciences, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), supervised by（某位导师）. In my final year of doctoral studies, I was a visiting scholar at the （实验室或学院）, [University of Hanover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/), supervised by （某位导师）.

My primary research interests lie in the mapping, image processing and pattern recognition.
